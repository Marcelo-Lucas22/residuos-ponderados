In solving the groundwater flow and mass transport equations this approach allows a functional representation of the dispersion tensor, transmissivity tensor, and fluid velocity, as well as an accurate representation of boundaries of irregular geometry. A field application of the method to chromium contamination on Long Island, New York, shows that accurate simulations can be obtained by using the Galerkin-finite element approach.},

@article{Zhang2024,
   abstract = {ABSTRACTMany mineral deposits have low resistivity. This property makes the electromagnetic (EM) method a very useful tool for mineral exploration. In the past few decades, the application of EM exploration technologies has been reviewed by many researchers. However, most reviews focused on EM exploration methods, the development of equipment, or their applications. Three-dimensional forward modeling and inversions are high-accuracy EM interpretation techniques in which great progress has been made in recent years in mineral exploration. We review the development of EM technology for mineral exploration with a focus on 3D EM forward modeling, inversion technology, and its applications. We first briefly introduce the EM methods for mineral exploration. Next, we give a comprehensive review of 3D EM forward modeling, inversion, and data interpretation, with special attention paid to the development of EM theory and applications in mineral exploration. We hope this review can promote the application of 3D EM numerical simulation and inversion in mineral exploration.},

@article{pridmore1981,
   abstract = {The finite?element method can be used to solve the differential equations which describe electrical and electromagnetic (EM) field behavior. The equations are, respectively, Poisson's equation and the vector, damped wave equation. The finite?element equations are derived, in both cases, using the minimum theorem. While both tetrahedral and hexahedral elements may be used for the modeling of the resistivity problem, only hexahedral elements give satisfactory results for the EM problem. A disadvantage of the relatively simple mesh design used in the approach described here is the presence of long thin elements. Such elements have very poor interpolating properties, and they adversely affect the rate of convergence of the overrelaxation technique used in solving the resulting system of linear equations. For the modeling of resistivity data over an earth with one plane of symmetry, the system of equations typically has about 9000 unknowns. About 50,000 unknowns are needed to give a satisfactory solution to an EM problem where the earth has one plane of symmetry. The advantage of solving these problems with a technique such as the finite?element method is that earths with an almost arbitrary distribution of conductivity can be modeled. On the other hand, an integral?equation method can be far more cost effective for small inhomogeneities. The results from the resistivity algorithm show the adverse effect of an irregular, conducting, and polarizable overburden on dipole?dipole, induced polarization surveys. Modeling of a horizontal loop EM survey illustrates the importance of assessing the host rock conductivity before attempting to interpret inhomogeneity responses.},

	abstract = {Electrical Resistivity Tomography data were acquired along 40km of the Monterey Bay coast in central California. These data resulted in electrical resistivity images to depths of approximately 280m.b.s.l., which were used to understand the distribution of freshwater and saltwater in the subsurface, and factors controlling this distribution. The resulting resistivity sections were interpreted in conjunction with existing data sets, including well logs, seismic reflection data, geologic reports, hydrologic reports, and land use maps from the region. Interpretation of these data shows a complex pattern of saltwater intrusion resulting from geology, pumping, and recharge. The resistivity profiles were used to identify geological flow conduits and barriers such as palaeo-channels and faults, localized saltwater intrusion from individual pumping wells, infiltration zones of surface fresh and brackish water, and regions showing improvements in water quality due to management actions. The use of ERT data for characterizing the subsurface in this region has led to an understanding of the spatial distribution of freshwater and saltwater at a level of detail unattainable with the previously deployed traditional well based salinity mapping and monitoring techniques alone. Significant spatial variability in the extent and geometry of intrusion observed in the acquired data highlights the importance of adopting continuous subsurface characterization methods such as this one.}
